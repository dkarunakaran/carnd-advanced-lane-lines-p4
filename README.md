## Advanced Lane Finding
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)
 
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

#### Camera Calibration

#### Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

#### Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

#### Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

#### Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

#### Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

#### Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

#### Pipeline (video)

#### Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?
